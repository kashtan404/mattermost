### 19 Multimedia

When pre-recorded multimedia content (synchronized video and audio) is provided, equivalent alternatives also must be provided for people who either can't hear the audio or can't see the video.

Captions help people who are deaf or have a hearing loss by providing an equivalent alternative for the audio in multimedia content. Captions should convey the dialogue, identify who is speaking, and provide other information conveyed through audio, such as music and sound effects.

Audio description helps blind and low vision people by providing an equivalent alternative for the video in multimedia content. Audio description should include information about actions, characters, scene changes, on-screen text, and other visual content.

#### Do

Provide captions for multimedia content. (WCAG 1.2.2)

- If captions are missing, add them.
    - Use closed captions (visible on demand) if possible.
    - Use open captions (always visible) if your media player or hosting provider doesn't support closed captions.
- Make sure the captions provide an accurate and complete description of the audio content:
    - Include all speech.
    - Identify the speakers.
    - Describe any other meaningful sounds.

Provide audio description for multimedia content. (WCAG 1.2.5)

- Use any of these approaches:
    - Build the audio description into the video’s main soundtrack.
    - Make another video with the audio description.
    - Add an extra audio track that includes the audio description.
- Make sure the audio description includes important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone, such as:
    - Actions
    - Characters
    - Scene changes
    - On-screen text
    - Any other meaningful visual content
- Make sure the audio description is synchronized with the video content.
    - Ideally, narrate events “real time,” as they happen onscreen.
- Screen events are accompanied by meaningful sounds, describe them just before they happen.

#### Don't

Don't let captions obscure any meaningful visual content. (WCAG 1.2.2)

- Adjust the position or timing of the captions to avoid a conflict.
